# Testing regex counts; should be 3 or 5
As you can see by \(eq1\) and \(eq2\) you can have multiple of these in a line

And we're trying math 
$$
x\cdot y\times z
$$ 
or 
$$
f(x) = x^2
$$ 

or all in one line with \(x\cdot y\times z\) or \(f(x) = x^2\)

$$
\mathbf{M}_{projection}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{r-l} & 0 & 0 & -\frac{r+l}{r-l} \\\\
0 & \frac{2}{t-b} & 0 & -\frac{t+b}{t-b} \\\\
0 & 0 & \frac{2}{n-f} & -\frac{n+f}{n-f} \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$


testing:
\(eq**1\) and \(eq**2\) but after \(eq1\) and \(eq2\)
